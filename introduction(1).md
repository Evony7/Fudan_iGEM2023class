I am from the School of Information Science and Technology, majoring in Biomedical Engineering.

- In art design, I often use **PS, Lr, procreate and other software**.
- I have participated in the student work of Fudan University Students' Union Integrated Media Center, Tengfei College Self-Management Association Cultural and Creative Design Department, Astronomy Association, Volleyball Association, CESI Business Association's Publicity Department, the main work is to participate in the planning of a project, and then design the poster header banner design cultural and creative design public number layout, won awards such as **excellent officer of student organization in 2020** and **advanced individual of student organization in 2021**.

I came to IGEM because I wanted to have more research experience, on the other hand, I hope my professional knowledge can be put into practice and create some value in application, and I think the concept of discipline integration of IGEM and my own major, biomedical engineering, fits very well.
